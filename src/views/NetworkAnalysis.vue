              <h2> Westworld network</h2>
              <p> In the figure below the network containing all of the characters in the show is displayed. Each one of the nodes is a character in the show. The red nodes are the hosts and the blue nodes are the humans. The edges are the connections between the characters throughout the show. </p>

              <p> As we can see the network in westworld is fairly interconnected. Since the stage for the show is a so called theme park, where hosts and humans are free to roam and interact with each other, it is logical that the characters will inevitably cross paths and connect. </p>

              <p>From the graph we can see that the nodes with the most connections are <b>Teddy</b> and <b>Dolores</b>, since they are 2 of the main characters. They both have <b>17</b> connections. The 3 nodes with the highest eigenvector centrality are <b>Teddy</b>, <b>Dolores</b> and <b>Robert</b>. The 3 nodes with the highest betweenness centrality are <b>Stubbs</b>, <b>Teddy</b> and <b>Dolores</b>.

              <h2> Network evolution over time</h2>
              <p> With the following set of graphs we can see how the network of characters evolve throughout the show over time. From the network figures it is easy to see how the show sometimes focuses on the host on certain episodes and sometimes on the humans.</p>
